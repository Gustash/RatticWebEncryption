# RatticWebEncryption
This project was forked from the original RatticWeb (https://github.com/tildaslash/RatticWeb).

# Disclaimer
I used a docker image when I started developing the changes to the original project for the company I'm working for. Because of that, I couldn't for the repository onto my GitHub since it didn't want to merge my commits smoothly.

I would like to show my gratitude for the people who built the original project from the ground up and to my coworkers for helping me improve RatticWeb.

# Changes
This RatticWeb version includes AES encryption for group passwords and and RSA encryption for private passwords. Oh, that's right, it also adds private password support.

Not only that, but it adds a feature where you can request temporary access to a password from another group, warning the admins of that group by email and granting access from within the app or by an email reply.

I didn't have much time to document, so if you have any doubts or concerns about this version, feel free to email me at gustavotcparreira@gmail.com
